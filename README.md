Python3 API connector for Bybit's HTTP and Websockets APIs.

Hi all—

`pybit` has now become the official Python wrapper for Bybit's API and is available at https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit. This repository has been archived and is now read-only. If you wish to create a pull request or issue, please head over to Bybit's fork.

Appreciate all the help and support, but my time has been taken up by other projects. Two Bybit developers (Dexter and MJ) have been helping me upkeep the project, and have been kind enough to take over maintanence.

~ ❤️ Verata
